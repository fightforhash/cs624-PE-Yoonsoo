Input

This app requires no user input. All text data—name, degree, and school—are hardcoded directly in the code using Text components.

Process

When the app runs, React Native renders a View with a yellow background. Inside it, three Text components display the hardcoded messages. Styling is handled through a StyleSheet that sets layout alignment and text appearance. The process follows a simple static rendering pipeline without any dynamic logic.

Output

The output is a web or mobile screen showing the user’s name, degree program, and school name in three lines. The text is centered on a yellow background, with each line clearly styled and spaced for readability. No user interaction or updates occur.
